妈咪
Mommy!

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,940
他要来抓我了
He's gonna get me!

4
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,680
亲爱的 亲爱的 谁要来抓你
Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,050
总统 我看见他了
The president! I saw him!

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,550
他要来抓我了
He's gonna get me!

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,520
克丽丝特尔 总统不会来抓你的
Crystal, the president isn't going to get you.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,890
但我看到他了
But I saw him!

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,910
看到我说的了吧
See what I told you?

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,720
这就是她非要去的自由党学校
It's that liberal school she's going to,

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,030
看看都往她脑袋里装了什么东西
filling her head with all kinds of garbage.

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,430
亲爱的 总统在尽他所能地工作呢
Sweetie, the president is doing the best job he can.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,060
你们学校只是
Your liberal school is just trying

14
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,500
想让你们相信他很危险
to convince you he's dangerous.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,870
但 但是 爸爸 他要来
But... But, Daddy, he's gonna...

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,230
打住 到此为止
Unh-unh. No "Buts."

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,970
总统在白宫
The president is in the White House,

18
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,740
才不会跑来这抓你 好吗
not here trying to get you, okay?

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,210
-好吧 - 行了
- Okay. - All right.

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,880
我们明早得和学校谈谈了
We're having a talk with that school in the morning.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,480
晚安 亲爱的
Goodnight, honey.

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,890
嘿 我的支持率如何
Hey! How are my approval ratings?

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,270
最新报道称
And the latest reports are now saying

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,830
超过一百万的加拿大人
that over a million Canadians

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
在核爆炸中丧生
were killed in the nuclear blast.

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,110
由美国总统下令投放的炸弹
The bomb dropped by the U.S. President

27
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,140
铲平了整个多伦多市
took out the entire city of Toronto

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,610
在未来几天里 核辐射尘预计会导致
and fallout is expected to kill thousands more

29
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,280
数千人丧生
in the coming days.

30
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
艾克
Ike.

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,320
艾克 对不起
Ike, I'm sorry that I...

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,720
是我导致加拿大遭到了核弹袭击
'caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada.

33
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,760
我只是
I was just...

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,060
我只是想
You know, I was just trying

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,990
叫停那个毒害大众的剧
to get shows that were toxic taken down.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
你也知道那些剧真的害人不浅
You know, those shows can be really harmful.

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,800
噢 别假惺惺了
Oh, stop being a victim.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,130
老天呐
Jesus Christ!

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,070
我想知道的是 谁给你的权利
What I want to know is what gives you the right

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,440
向我的孩子们宣扬你的政治观点
to preach your political views to my children?!

41
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,710
我的女儿晚上在噩梦中惊醒
Our daughter woke up with nightmares

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,020
就是梦到总统要来抓她
that the president was going to get her.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
就算校长和副校长
Just because two liberals happen to be

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,620
碰巧是两个支持自由党的人
principal and vice principal

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,060
也不意味着你们可以给我的孩子们洗脑
doesn't mean you can brainwash my kids!

46
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,160
呃 我们现在面临着更大的问题
Uh, we sort of have some bigger problems

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,530
先生你是
right now, Mister, uh...

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,360
是怀特 鲍勃 怀特
It's White. Bob White.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,930
你可能从未听说过我们一家吧
You've probably never even heard of our family, huh?

50
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,830
怀特家族从建校起就在这上学了
Well, the Whites have been here since the beginning!

51
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,130
那也不重要
Not that it matters.

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,900
因为没人关心怀特一家
'Cause no one cares about the Whites!

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,570
没错 每个人都有自己的麻烦
Sure, everyone else has problems,

54
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,410
但有人关心过怀特一家过得怎么样吗
but does anyone ever ask the Whites how they're doing?

55
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,680
怀特先生 我们向你保证 我们管理这所学校的
Mr. White, we assure you that we run the school

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,710
方式十分专业
in a very... professional manner

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,210
并且不会让个人情感
and don't let... personal emotions

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,420
影响工作
get in the way.

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,150
你们当然不会
Oh, sure you don't!

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,650
你们知道我费了多大劲
You know how hard I had to fight

61
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,190
才能来这和你们见面吗
to even get this meeting with you?

62
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,590
噢 是谁想和行政部门谈谈
"Oh, who wants to talk to the administration?"

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,060
噢 只是怀特一家吗
"Oh, it's just the Whites?"

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,260
谁管怀特一家怎么样 他们不重要
"Aw, who cares about the Whites? They're fine."

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,330
我们正打算把它
Well, we've just about had it you...

66
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,030
#如果爱你是个错 就让我错下去吧#
# If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right #

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,940
#就让我错下去吧#
# I don't wanna be right #

68
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,870
还有 该死的 我们被无视了
...and, damn it, we won't be ignored!

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,630
抱歉 有谁听到
I'm sorry. Is anyone else hearing

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,810
如果爱你是个错 就让我错下去吧
"If loving you is wrong, I Don't Want to Be Right"

71
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,380
非常非常小声
very, very quietly?

72
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,910
不是的 怀特先生和夫人
Uh, no. Mr. And Mrs. White,

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,520
我们保证我们不会让
we promise that we will not let anything happen

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,350
可能会使这所学校公正性遭到质疑的事发生
that might bring the integrity of this school into question.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
我想怀特一家现在也就能这样指望了
Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,970
嗨
Hey!

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,510
我的支持率如何
How are my approval ratings?

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,820
是总统啊
It's the president!

79
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,420
等等 回来 有什么问题吗
Wait, come back! What's wrong?!

80
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,720
总统仍没有
Still no word from the president

81
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,830
对他的贱番茄支持率跌到
as his 'Splatty Tomato' approval rating

82
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,100
前所未有的3%做出回应
drops to an unprecedented 3%.

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,270
这样 总统的支持率
This puts the president four points below

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,930
比抢劫坚果店2的票房还低了四个点
"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature."

85
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,740
同时 加拿大总理
Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister,

86
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,240
贾斯廷 特鲁多号召加拿大人民要坚强
Justin Trudeau, called upon Canadians to stand strong.

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,610
毫无疑问 美国
Make no mistake, America.

88
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,750
如果你们不交出你们的总统
If you do not hand over your president,

89
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,620
就会发生你们前所未见的战争
there will be war the likes of which you have never seen.

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,450
加拿大人会团结起来
Canadians will rise together.

91
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,450
我呼吁海内外所有的加拿大人
I call on all Canadians here and abroad

92
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,560
和他们的国家同仇敌忾
to stand with their country.

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,630
美国总统必须为他的罪行负责
The U.S. President must answer for his crime.

94
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,100
只有加拿大能把他绳之以法
And only Canada can bring him to justice.

95
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,870
没事的 特维克 一切都会好起来的
There, there, Tweek. Everything is gonna be okay.

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,140
我知道我看到了什么 克雷格 你要相信我
I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me!

97
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,880
怎么了
What's going on?

98
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,810
特维克急性焦虑症发作了
Tweek's having a panic attack.

99
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,320
是真的 他想要抓我
It was real! He tried to get me!

100
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,910
- 你说谁 - 总统
- Who did? - The president!

101
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,320
这只是你的想象 特维克
It's just your imagination, Tweek.

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,460
这不是他想象出来的
It's not his imagination.

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,730
我也看见他了
I saw him, too.

104
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,130
你也看到总统了
You saw the president?

105
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,530
在采石场外面 我当时还不敢相信
Out by the quarry, but I didn't believe it.

106
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,170
我想 这怎么可能是
I said, "How could this be..."

107
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,700
总统吗 我也看见他了
The president? I saw him, too.

108
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,970
他穿着一套蓝色的西装 还有一张屎黄的脸
He had a blue suit and an orange face.

109
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,970
他一直在问我 我的
He kept asking me, "How are my..."

110
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,710
我的支持率如何
"How are my approval ratings?"

111
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,210
我也看见他了
I saw him, too.

112
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,250
哥们 这些听起来是不是很耳熟
Dude, isn't this all really familiar?

113
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,750
我在那个叫怪奇什么的剧里
I saw something just like this

114
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,980
看到了类似的情节
on that show called "Stranger..."

115
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,650
怪奇物语
"Stranger Things."

116
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,490
怪奇物语是部剧 我也看了
"Stranger Things" Is the show. I saw it, too.

117
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,490
但等等 怪奇物语不就像那部电影
But wait, isn't "Stranger Things" Just like that movie...

118
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,200
就像电影小丑回魂
Just like that movie "It."

119
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
你也看了吗
You saw it, too?

120
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,970
对啊 我在电影院里看的
Yeah, I saw it in the theater.

121
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,970
我也看了怪奇物语和小丑回魂
I saw "Stranger Things" And "It."

122
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,640
天哪
Jesus.

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,010
我觉得大家都没有胡说
I don't think anyone's imagining anything.

124
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,940
我觉得总统就在这
I think the president is here.

125
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,580
孩子们进屋去
You kids get inside somewhere.

126
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,880
我得去提醒镇上的人
I have to warn the town.

127
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,620
好了 大家 大家 安静
All right, people. People, please.

128
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,960
我们需要大家都努力保持冷静
We need everyone to try and stay calm.

129
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,730
总统在这吓唬我们的小孩
How can we stay calm when the president's

130
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,230
我们要怎么冷静
out there scaring our children?!

131
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,860
听着 我们都想让总统离开这里
Look, we all want the president out of here.

132
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,770
现在就是我们要怎么做的问题
It's just a matter of how we do it.

133
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,230
我知道你们都想摆脱他
I know you all want to get rid of him.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
这不对
That's not true.

135
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
怀特一家还支持着总统
The Whites still support the president!

136
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,710
得了吧 怀特 他四处乱跑
Oh, for sake, White, he's running around

137
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,980
吃我们的宠物 恐吓我们的孩子
eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!

138
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,910
你觉得希拉里会做得更好吗
You think Hillary would have been any better?

139
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,280
坐下吧 鲍勃
Just sit down, Bob!

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,380
我只是说说而已 说说而已
I'm just sayin'! I'm just sayin'!

141
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,950
大家听着 我现在有一组人
Listen, everyone. I have a team right now

142
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,620
在尝试确定总统的位置
that's trying to locate the president,

143
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,550
我希望你们能听领导这次搜寻行动的
and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright,

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,420
布莱特警官说几句
who's leading the search.

145
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,390
大家好 我们知道你们都很关心
Hey, folks. We know you're all concerned,

146
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,930
但我想向你们保证 我们在尽我们所能
but I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can

147
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,400
追查总统的下落 并且让他安全地离开
to track the president down and have him safely removed.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,770
自从总统的支持率这么差以后
Since the president was given a splatty tomato,

149
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,440
他就变得非常危险且不顾一切
he's become very desperate and very dangerous.

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,510
如果你看到总统 不要接近他
If you see the president, do not approach him.

151
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,680
不要和他理论
Do not try to reason with him.

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,980
最重要的是要记住 这可是总统
Most importantly, remember that this is the president,

153
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,310
你不能开枪去打他 好吗
so you cannot shoot him. All right?

154
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,720
连讲都不要讲
You can't even talk about shooting him.

155
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
甚至都不要
Don't even...

156
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,220
做一些要击杀他的讽刺的举动
do any coy satirical takes on shooting him.

157
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,660
好的
Okay, good.

158
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,160
我们想要做的
What we're trying to do here

159
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
只是把总统赶走
is just get the president to go away.

160
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,500
我们会给你们发放这样的锁
We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one

161
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,370
这样每个人都可以把自己的车库锁起来
so everyone can lock up their garbage.

162
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,170
如果我们不给总统食物 他应该会走掉的
If we don't feed the president, hopefully he'll just move on.

163
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,800
有什么问题吗
Are there any questions?

164
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,310
我们可以用一种略带讽刺的方式
Can we talk about a friend shooting him

165
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,610
和朋友讨论击杀他的事情吗
if it's in a sort of a sarcastic way?

166
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,610
不不不 现在最好是
No, no, no. Now, it's - it's just best

167
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,950
干脆不要谈论这样的事情了
to avoid that kind of talk altogether.

168
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,350
记住 他们可以对凯西 格里芬做什么
Remember, they can do to you

169
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,850
也可以对你们做什么
what they did to Kathy Griffin.

170
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,720
让她30年不能再搞笑了
Made her not funny for 30 years?

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,190
没错
That's right.

172
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,950
所以最好的办法就是把车库锁起来
So best thing is just lock up your garbage

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,160
然后看看总统会不会离开
and see if we can get the president to go away.

174
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,330
天哪
Jesus.

175
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,860
现在孩子们开始不见了
Now kids are going missing.

176
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,570
不久我们都会不见的
We're all gonna be missing soon!

177
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,840
凯尔
Kyle!

178
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,640
都是我的错
It's my fault.

179
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,170
艾克想要自己把事情摆平
Ike went to go take matters into his own hands.

180
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,640
我必须要去找他
I have to find him.

181
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,580
我们会帮你的
We'll help you.

182
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,980
我们都会帮你的
We'll all help you.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,880
大伙 这是相当危险的事情啊
Guys, this could be really dangerous.

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
你不许去
You're not going.

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,050
你答应过我 今天晚上我们要约会的
You promised tonight we'd have a date night.

186
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,280
亲爱的 这比约会之夜更紧急啊
Darling, this is a little more pressing than date night.

187
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,990
哦 好吧
Oh, great.

188
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,420
也就是说 凯尔的笨蛋兄弟消失了 而我
So, Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get

189
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,160
我怎么总是卷在这种破事里面
How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here?

190
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,100
你们谁都别跟我去
I don't need anyone to go with me.

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,540
哦 怎么了 凯尔
Oh, what's the matter, Kyle?

192
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,840
不想要我一起去
Don't want me around because

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,870
因为你喜欢我而我拒绝了你吗
you had the hots for me and I shut you down?

194
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,400
我绝不会喜欢上现在的你了
I would never ve the hots for the person you are now.

195
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,720
拜托了 各位
Come on, you guys.

196
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,630
听着 我们都知道现在要做什么了
Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now.

197
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,840
我们都看见过 小丑回魂 还有 怪奇物语
We all saw "It" And "Stranger Things."

198
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,910
我们要背上包包进到森林里
We need to get our backpacks and go out to woods

199
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,180
把咱镇从那个恶魔 还有80年代音乐中救出来
and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music!

200
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,220
你好啊 今天中午要在我们这吃饭吗
Hello, joining us for lunch today?

我们是带今日的优秀学生来

与校长和副校长一起吃午餐的
to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal.

我们为你预备了很好的座位
We have a nice booth set up for you.

211
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,640
我们不能继续下去了
We can't keep doing this.

212
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,410
人们会看出来的
People are gonna see through it.

213
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,810
难道在工作中
Is it my fault that I found

214
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,880
找到最棒最完美最美丽的女人
the most amazing, perfect, beautiful woman...

215
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
是我的错吗
at work?

216
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,120
没人会懂的
Nobody will understand.

217
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,350
或许他们会的
Maybe they will.

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,220
我们是坠入爱河的同事
We're co-workers who are in love.

219
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,930
你真的觉得这对其他人有影响吗
You really that's going to bother people?

220
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,500
额 我们要开始点餐了吗
Well, should we order now?

221
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,850
鲍勃 你在干什么
What are you doing, Bob? Aah!

222
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,490
你是在故意把食物拿出去吸引总统吗
Have you been putting food out for the president?

223
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,950
不 我只是 额
No, I was just, uh,

224
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,880
把这些手指三明治扔掉
taking these finger sandwiches to the trash.

225
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,790
我们都同意不要喂他 这样他就会离开
We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away.

226
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,120
不是全体都同意了 是你们同意的
We didn't all agree! You all agreed!

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,990
没人问过怀特家的想法
Nobody asked the Whites how they felt!

228
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,230
没人会在意怀特家会怎么说
Nobody cares what the Whites have to say!

229
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,830
鲍勃 拜托
Bob, come on.

230
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,800
你要知道他待在这里对我们很不安全
You have to know it's not safe to have him here.

231
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
2003年的时候 希拉里 克林顿
In 2003, Hillary Clinton admitted

232
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,830
挪用了外交官的基金
to taking funds for her foundation

233
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,500
转入自己的基金会
from foreign diplomats!

234
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,670
拜托 这两者之间有什么联系吗 鲍勃
What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on.

235
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,310
这是真的
It's true!

236
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,340
鲍勃 如果加拿大发现总统藏在这里
Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here,

237
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,650
他们会用核弹攻击我们的
they are going to nuke us.

238
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,010
他必须离开
He needs to go.

239
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,520
希拉里当了总统也不会好到哪儿去
Hillary wouldn't have been any better.

240
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,650
把手指三明治给我
Give me the finger sandwiches.

241
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,050
好吧
Fine!

242
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,190
就这样 把怀特的三明治带走吧
Go ahead and take the White's sandwiches!

243
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,560
反正他们都把所有东西带走了
They've taken everything else!

244
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,160
我们是芝加哥熊队跳鬼步
# We are the Bears shufflin' through #

245
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,570
为了你 跳鬼步
# Shufflin' on down, doin' it for you #

246
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,700
我们很坏 但是我们知道自己是好意
# We're so bad we know we're good #

247
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,000
像计划好的一样刷新你的三观
# Blowin' your mind like we knew we would #

248
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,310
我们来就是为了制造麻烦
# We're not here to start no trouble #

249
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,380
我们只是在跳超级碗鬼步舞
# We're just here to do the Super Bowl shuffle #

250
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,040
兄弟们 这是80年代的音乐吗
Dude, this is '80s' music?

251
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,350
是的 这是潘多拉 是80年代的频道
Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s channel.

252
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,110
跳下一首吧 兄弟
Well, just skip to the next song, man.

253
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,500
我们想要振作起来 消灭恶魔
We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil.

254
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,920
我们需要更好一些的80年代音乐
We need better '80s' music than that.

255
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,250
歌莉娅
# Gloria #

256
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,890
你总是在追求
# You're always on the run now #

257
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,380
追求某人
# Running after somebody #

258
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,530
你总会得到他的
# You gotta get him somehow #

259
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,230
我觉得你要慢一些
#I think you've got to slow down #

260
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,100
海蒂 宝宝 你在干什么
Heidi. Honey, what are you doing?

261
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,640
这里是
This is the place...

262
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,580
这里是我终结一切的地方 记得吗
This is the place where I ended it all, remember?

263
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,410
我把手机从这座桥上扔下去
This is where I threw my phone off the bridge

264
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,380
然后永远退出了推特
and quit Twitter for good.

265
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,880
我曾经那么不同
I was so different then...

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,250
那么天真 充满希望
so naive and hopeful.

267
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,650
是的 甜心 现在我们可以继续走了吗
Yes, honey, now, can we get going, please?

268
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,460
抱歉 让我一个人静静
I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here!

269
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,760
这里是我们开始的地方 你这个混蛋
This is where our whole relationship started, asshole!

270
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,860
是的 甜心 这很感人
Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart.

271
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,430
我非常的爱你
I love you so much.

272
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,730
我很抱歉 伙计们
I'm sorry about this, you guys.

273
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,270
我想起了孤单的日子
I remember feeling like I had nobody.

274
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,140
瘦瘦的我
Skinny bitch.

275
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,210
我们要继续走了 大家
We need to keep going, guys.

276
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,180
别告诉我你还没把总统弄走
Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here.

277
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,250
我们还没把总统弄走
We haven't gotten the President out of here.

278
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,820
还有一些更坏的消息
And there's some worse news.

279
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,720
一群孩子消失了
A bunch of kids have gone missing.

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,990
- 什么 - 我觉得我们必须要假设
- What? - I think we have to assume

281
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,460
总统已经 把他们吃掉了
that the President has... eaten them.

282
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,790
为什么你还在这里和我说话
Why are you here talking to me

283
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,790
不是应该去找一下总统吗
instead of trying to find the President?!

284
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,860
别担心 快找到了 他就在树林里的某处
Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere.

285
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,500
而且我们设置了一个 福克斯 陷阱
And we've set up a fox trap.

286
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,340
一个 福克斯 陷阱
A fox trap?

287
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,690
福克斯新闻
Oh, Fox News...

288
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,190
他们会听我讲话的
They'll listen to me.

289
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,390
他们会洗白我的
They'll get my side of the story right!

290
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,960
这是个陷阱
It's a trap!

291
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,170
什么
What?

292
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,970
这是个福克斯陷阱 总统先生
It's a Fox trap, Mr. President!

293
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,410
哦 多亏了怀特一家
Oh, thank God for the Whites...

294
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,480
在这样的夜里 艾克 艾克
# Hold on to the nights # Ike! Ike?!

295
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,720
在这样的记忆里
# Hold on to the memories #

296
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,890
兄弟 拜托 这不是最棒的80年代的音乐
Dude. Come on! This is not kick-ass '80s music!

297
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,090
在这样的夜里 理查 马克斯 1988年
"Hold On to the Nights" Richard Marx. 1988.

298
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
我们真的需要音乐吗
Do we really need music?

299
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,160
是的 克雷格用错软件了
Yeah! Craig just has the wrong stuff.

300
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,270
别用潘多拉了 我要用Spotify
Forget your Pandora. I'm doing Spotify.

307
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,050
快要疯了
# Going out of my mind #

308
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,350
就是这里
Here it is.

309
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,420

我记得我还为你感到难过

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,860
我们过去常常坐在公园里聊上几个小时

316
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,000
为什么我们再也不这么做了

根本没有去找总统
Didn't even go looking for the President.

327
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,980
你不了解加拿大人
You don't understand Canadians.

328

他们对自己的国家很忠诚
They're fiercely loyal to their country.

他们在一起了
They're together!

谁在一起了
Who's together?

校长和副校长
The Principal and the Vice Principal!

351
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,530
他们不能在一起 他们是同事
They can't be together! They're co-workers!

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,560
等等 你是说他是她的上级
Wait, wait. You mean he's actually her superior

然后他们在那里
and they were in there...

354
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,140
谁会想把自己的小弟弟放进同事身体里
Who would want to put their penis in a co-worker?!

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,120
小丑不是唯一的傻瓜
# The Joker ain't the only fool #

358

谁会愿意为你做任何事

There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and...

369
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,140
你差点害死我

370
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,540
亲爱的 你让我在南瓜园里迟到了 记得吗
Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember?

371

- 我很受伤 - 你很受伤
I was hurt. You were hurt!

372
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,680

闭嘴 皮包骨屁股的小贱人
Shut up! Skinny-ass bitch!

376
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,360
你什么都不知道
You don't know anything!

377
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,390
海蒂 我觉得在树林里诡异的散步
Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods

378
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,060
让你有点失去理智了

至少这个男人想拯救圣诞节
At least this man's trying to save Christmas!

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,850
没错
That's true!

415
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,540
他不是在拯救圣诞节 鲍勃
He's not saving Christmas, Bob.

416
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,470
他到处乱跑 吓唬你的孩子们
He's running around, scaring your kids,

417
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,760
在树林里拉屎
and shitting in the woods.

418
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,860

宝贝 把枪放下 好吗

我当受害者当成了一种生活方式
I let being a victim become a way of life.

如果你总是以为自己是受害者
If you always make yourself the victim,

430
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,700
那就证明你是很糟糕的
you can justify being awful.

我必须学会停止为自己感到难过
I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself.

437
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,510

438
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,380

后退 我会这么做的 我发誓

441
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,620
这次不管用了 埃里克
It's not gonna work this time, Eric.

442
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,690
你跟我分手 我就自杀
You break up with me, I will kill myself!

443
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,130
这是你的选择 海蒂
The choice is yours, Heidi!

444
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,390
快点 各位
Come on, everybody!

445

埃里克 我们不想让你死
"Eric, we don't want you to die."

446
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,370
你可以做受害者
You can be the victim.

448
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,400
我不行
I can't.

449
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,030
海蒂
Heidi!

450
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,340
海蒂 我会开枪的 动手了
Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go!

451
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,240
海蒂 你真的
Heidi?! Are you seriously...

452
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,510
他挣脱了绳子
He broke free.

453
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,510
总统又逍遥法外了
The president is on the loose again.

454
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,050
他现在更绝望了
